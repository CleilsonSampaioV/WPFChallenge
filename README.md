# C#/WPF Challenge

AIS C#/WPF Challenge

Hey, what's up? Are you ready to start the challenge? We would like to remember that this step will help us evaluate your performance. Take a deep breath and let’s go!
We’re rooting for you. 😁

## Some Rules

1 - **DO NOT** share your answer with others.

2 - Remember that this challenge is meant to evaluate your skills, you don't necessarily have to finish **all** the challenge code implementation, we just want to get know you better. 😁

## Steps

- Fork the repository.
- Create a branch (from master branch) with the following pattern:
  Use your name as branch name, eg:
  Considering that my name is Jose da Silva the branch name should be: "feature/jose_silva"
- Work **only** on your branch, and after you finish, create a Pull Request targeting "master" branch on this repository.
- **DO NOT** change the reviewers of your Pull Request.

# Requirements 

* .NET Framework 4.7.2 (Usually already provided with Windows 10 installations)

## Instructions
For the purposes of this challenge, we recommend using Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.
We have already set up a VS solution with a C#/WPF template project associated with it.
We suggest using this initial structure as a starting point for you.

After set it all up, let's go to the challenge \o/

## Challenge 

Consider a basic Windows desktop application used for recording customer data, with the following requirements:

* It must be developed using C# and WPF, of course;

* It must received as input the following customer data:

  * Name;

  * E-mail;

  * Phone;

  * Address;

* User must provide the aforementioned data by means of a registration form in MainWindow;

* Existing customer data must be displayed in table format also in MainWindow;

* When applicable, buttons must be provided for basic operations such as:

  * Customer creation;
  * Customer editing;
  * Customer deletion;

During the challenge, please consider the following:

* Feel free to implement UX/UI the way you think is good (assume a real-world scenario);

* Regarding software architecture/design, also feel free to do it the way you think we will be able to see you at your finest;

* During software construction, please bear in mind keeping the code as clean and maintainable as possible;

* Please provide unit tests for all you think is necessary to be tested (you can use xUnit, for example);

* As we have previously mentioned, you do not need to solve this challenged in its entirety, but we will surely take your best effort into consideration;

Happy Coding!
